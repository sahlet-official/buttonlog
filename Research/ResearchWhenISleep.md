There is a need to know when the person sleeps.
There is an idea to estimate the moment of the start of speep - monitor some user actions on a smartphone.

### Conclusion:

It can be seen from the analysis that applications fixing the moment of falling asleep are presented on the market, and have great success. All of them record the moment of falling asleep either with a microphone or with a fitness tracker.

From the list of applications, the condition for fixing the moment of falling asleep corresponds to: "Sleep Cycle", "Sleep Monitoring: Sleep Tracker", "Sleep as Android". 

Of these, I consider "Sleep as Android" to be the best choice. This application has the least number of cons, great functionality and is free.
