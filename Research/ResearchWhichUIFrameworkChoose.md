The best frameworks for cross-platform development are Flutter and React Native.
Flutter uses the Dart OOP language. The advantage of this platform over React is that it is more performant, 
since React uses less fast JS. For mobile applications, performance is one of the key factors.

Also, Dart is a more convenient language for me, in view of its OOP.

Both platforms are suitable for our project, since it is not a complex application, but I will give preference 
to Flutter, as I consider it more promising to learn and apply in further projects.
