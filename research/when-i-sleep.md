The desired application should help to establish the moment of falling asleep.

  I wrote down the most popular sleep monitoring apps that I
found on the forums, I also superficially examined the proposed
me options in Google Play.
Application Names: Sleep Cycle, Sleep Time, Twilight, Pzizz,
Calm, Sleep Monitoring: Sleep Tracker, Sleep as Android.

Sleep cycle

  The program is paid. There is a trial period of 30 days. After is issued
paid subscription 800 UAH/month. There is a smart alarm function. This function
allows you to wake up at the moment of the most suitable phase during a given
time interval.
  The application picks up the sounds made by the user through the microphone,
and, according to an algorithm that is incomprehensible to me, determines the moment of falling asleep. Same way
there are functions for determining sleep phases, according to which the application keeps statistics,
and can assess the quality of sleep. It also records night sounds made by the user, for example
dream conversations. Available in cooperation with WearOS fitness bracelets.

In general, the application has a function to read the moment of falling asleep, but
it is paid.

Sleep Time

  The application is a sleep calculator. That is beige, the user installs
the application the duration of its falling asleep, which it calculates itself (for example
15 minutes). The application recommends setting an alarm based on the time that
last sleep phases in order to wake up at the best moment.

  The application does not satisfy the requirement because it does not take into account the moment
falling asleep.

Twilight
  The application is absolutely not up to the requirement as it just changes
the light of the screen is more gentle on the eyes, which, according to the description, helps to fall asleep easier.

Sleep time is not recorded. Does not meet requirements.

Pzizz
  The application positions itself as a set of melodies that improve the process of falling asleep.
Also, judging by the reviews, it has a very bad monetary policy that forces you to pay
for subjectively helpful content.

Not suitable.

Calm
  The same as the Pzizz app. A set of melodies for sleep and melitation, with
bad monetary policy.

Not suitable.

Sleep Monitoring: Sleep Tracker
  The application registers the moment of falling asleep, through a microphone. Has the same set
functions as the application "Sleep Cycle" - smart alarm clock, sleep statistics + available
set of melodies for sleep. The application positions itself as free. Compatibility
with fitness trackers in the description is not found.

Suitable, as there is a registration of the moment of sleep.

Sleep as Android
  The application registers the moment of falling asleep, through a microphone. Has the same set
functions as the application "Sleep Cycle" - smart alarm clock, sleep statistics + available
set of melodies for sleep. The application positions itself as free, but there is paid content.
Compatible with fitness trackers. Of the interesting features - a mini-game after waking up to
prove that the user is awake, as well as the Anti-Snoring system. Smartphone, using some
sound makes a person stop snoring.

Suitable, as there is a registration of the moment of sleep.

From the whole list, I highlighted "Sleep Cycle", "Sleep Monitoring: Sleep Tracker", "Sleep as Android".
All these applications have the desired function of recording the moment of sleep + additional interesting
functions for monitoring sleep.
 I would prefer "Sleep Monitor: Sleep Tracker" and "Sleep as Android" since they can be used
is free. The further choice is already the decision of the user, which interface will be more convenient for him.
and what additional features he would prefer. I advise you to install both this and that and pro-
test them.
