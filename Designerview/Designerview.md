Task: develop ux/ui for the button log application.

To achieve the result, the following criteria were set for ux markup:

- ux markup should have a minimum of screens.
- design should be implementable for developers.

Based on UX requirements and product owner requirements, the following specifications were developed for the UI interface: 
Style: minimalism. 
Color palette: white, black and shades.

After clarification of the task, the following changes were made to the customer's UX scheme:
-side drop-down menu was removed and replaced with a lower central menu

The UX scheme was based on the scheme from ProdOwnerView

The development of the UI interface was divided into iterations, each of which will be accompanied by consultations with the product owner and development team.
The results of each iteration will be contributed to the repository, accompanied by a link to the Figma document.
