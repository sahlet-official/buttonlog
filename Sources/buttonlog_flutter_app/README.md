How to setup the project.<br/>

## Getting Started

To get started with our project, you must have Flutter, Android Studio installed.<br/>
You can also use VS Code as an editor. You can get installation instructions for all<br/>
of the above at this [link](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

To run the project, follow these steps:<br/>

1. Clone the repository on your device.
2. Open the project in your IDE. Project opening algorithm for Android Studio:<br/>
File->Open...-> select the folder with the project;<br/>
for VS Code: File->Open Folder-> select the folder with the project.<br/>
3. After opening the project, in the terminal, run the command:

4. Launch the android device emulator. Set up android emulator in [Android Studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMrKpOtDP4k)<br/>.
To use the emulator in VS Code, you can use the Android Studio creation emulator<br/>
by simply specifying this device before starting the debug, or use the suggestion options<br/>
from this [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-set-up-an-emulator-for-vscode/).<br/>
