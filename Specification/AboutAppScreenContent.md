# About
**Buttonlog** is a mobile app for logging device button events.<br>
The App logs the name of physical button and the time when it was pressed.<br>
You can view your button events log and filter records.<br>
Use your imagination and **Buttonlog** app will help you keep track of anything quickly and easily.<br>

## Motivation
The app was made as a [Proof of concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept) for another app - [**Sleeplog**](https://github.com/sahlet-official/sleeplog).<br>
The idea was to prove that it is it's convenient to mark when you did not sleep<br>
by pressing the button before you sleep and in the morning app will show you when it was last pressed.<br>
Also, the Buttonlog app is the first iteration of [**Sleeplog**](https://github.com/sahlet-official/sleeplog) app development.<br>
The team of authors of the program consists mainly of students.<br>
So it was decided to split the development process into iterations and execute the implementation step by step.<br>
With this approach, it is much easier for a team of young professionals firstly to design, implement,<br>
and produce a small and simple app to master the best practices for conducting a workflow, and then go further.<br>
