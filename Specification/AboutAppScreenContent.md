You can view your button events log and filter records.<br>
Use your imagination and Buttonlog app will help you keep track of anything quickly and easily.<br>

## Motivation
The app was made as [**Proof of concept**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept)<br>
for enother app - [Sleeplog](https://github.com/sahlet-official/sleeplog)<br>
The idea was to proof that it is comfortable to know when you did not sleep<br>
by pressing the button before you sleep and in the morning app will show you when was it last pressed.<br>
